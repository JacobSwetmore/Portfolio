                Hi! I'm Jacob, a Computing Science student from Staffordshire University.</h3>
            <div data-aos="fade-up" class="maintext">
                <p>Studying Computing Science has given me a broad knowledge of the Computing industry, during my first year at University,
                    I gained an intermediate understanding of Object Oriented programming languages, such as
                    <em class="language">Java</em> and
                    <em class="language">C++</em>, some of the most commonly used programming languages in the industry today. I also have a basic understanding
                    of
                    <em class="language">Python</em>. Many of my Java experiments from my first year can be found at my GitHub.
                    <br>
                    <br> It was during my first year that I fell in love with web technologies. I gained a solid grasp on
                    <em class="language">HTML</em>,
                    <em class="language">CSS</em> and
                    <em class="language">JavaScript,</em>
                    and decided to pursure them further, as I loved the creativity that I could express through this format. Some JavaScript examples can also be found on my GitHub.
                    <br>
                    <br> I am currently in my second year, where I study more Web Development based modules. I now have a great understanding
                    of Front End Web development, working in state of the art observation labs in order to master
                    <em class="language">UI/UX Design</em>. I have experience working with
                    <em class="language">frameworks</em>, and have a solid understanding of
                    <em class="language">Content Management Systems</em> such as WordPress. I am extremely capable of building user friendly websites with
                    ease, and consider it an absolute joy to do so.
                    <br>
                    <br>I am also familiar with both
                    <em class="language">SQL Server</em> and
                    <em class="language">Oracle</em>, and the general concept of databases.</p>
